["19december2023 nudging consumer choices exploring the ethicality of modifying consumer behavior when a consumer ventures out to the store many elements of the atmosphere in which they make their purchasing decisions may alter what they ultimately decide to buy", "where items are placed on the shelf the organization of the aisles the marketing on the individual packages and much more may alter the decision that the consumer makes", "this is the concept of nudge any aspect of the choice architecture that alters peoples behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives thaler sunstein 2008", "there are many examples of this nudging some of which will be covered by this paper but its important to note that there is controversy surrounding the ethicality of this practice", "what is the line between nudge and manipulation", "is it ethical to nudge consumers towards a desired outcome when doing so may change their decision", "do they still maintain their own autonomy", "the concept of nudge of indicating things to consumers to push them towards socially optimal decisions is itself ethical if consumers are conscious that this is occurring", "what may breach the ethical limit is the intentions of those implementing the nudge and the potential to hide them from consumers entirely", "transparency in the nudging process is necessary in order to maintain freewill and to not disempower consumers even if this transparency might dissuade consumers from the intended outcome that may be socially optimal", "pushing individuals towards the socially optimal outcome is just and has merit but if individuals ideals do not align with this outcome then it is not ethical to push them towards it", "nudge influences choice behavior through many different means from things as simple as changing the default that consumers use as their baseline to changing the way information is presented", "one example of such nudging was conducted by a group of researchers in a paper named are large portions always bad in which the authors present food in various size containers on packaging and find that by giving the impression of a larger portion on product packaging consumers find the food more desirable but also subsequently decrease the amount that they serve themselves petit2018", "this is an example of how the way information is presented has a drastic impact on consumer behavior suggesting that the food industry could utilize this knowledge to control consumer portion size and decision making", "this suggests that nudging could be used to improve consumer health something that the authors of the paper food bundling as a health nudge investigating consumer fruit and vegetables election using behavioral economics discuss in depth", "the authors presented fruits and vegetables within a store and varied whether bundles were displayed with and without a price discount finding that the offering of a bundle increased fruit and vegetable consumption carroll 2018", "this suggests that something as simple as the options for purchasing may have large scale impacts on consumer behavior and potentially their long term health", "nudging is thereby a very powerful tool that if utilized properly has the potential to have lasting effects on consumer health safety and overall wellbeing", "some authors have argued that nudging consumers to behave in a certain way is manipulative and wrong as nudge contravenes the coalition governments aspirations to promote ideas such as empowerment freedom and fairness and are not relevant as they are not capable of creating prolonged social change goodwin 2012", "this question of the ethicality of nudging has been passed back and forth between scholars fairly regularly other scholars have argued that despite its libertarian roots nudging is compatible with the promotion of personal autonomy and thus can be used to promote self empowerment in a non paternalistic fashion mills 2012", "both of these arguments have their merits nudging has the potential to greatly alter consumer behavior but that power comes with responsibility for the individuals who pose the nudge", "while the question of whether or not nudging may actually be able to make large scale chance considering much of the research that currently exists is small scale as the examples discussed above goodwins argument that nudging is completely unethical is not sound if consumers are aware that the nudge is occurring then it does not strip them of their rights or autonomy and merely serves to give them an indication of the socially optimal outcome", "it is important that those consumers who are being nudged are aware of what is occurring as their actions belong to them not the researchers who are attempting to nudge them", "being able to nudge consumers towards a collective and common goal has its merits but if that goal does not align with the consumers values then it is unethical to push them towards it without them knowing", "nudge is an incredibly powerful tool capable of pushing individuals towards better health and wellbeing outcomes", "with this influential force however comes complex ethical considerations", "the line between a gentle nudge and outright manipulation becomes crucial in assessing the morality of this practice", "the concept of nudge seems ethically sound when it involves altering consumers choices towards a socially optimal outcome but if the intentions of the person implementing the nudge are hidden transparency is compromised and the practice of nudging loses its merit", "nudging in scenarios like those outlined above in altering portion perceptions and influencing food choices for improved health outcomes emphasizes the potential that nudging has for creating a positive impact on consumer wellbeing but it is equally important to consider whether individuals are conscious of these influences and have the autonomy to make informed decisions that align with their values", "critics like goodwin and mills who argue that nudging is holistically good or bad must consider the context under which the nudge is presented nudging can be used for mutually beneficial outcomes if individuals are not manipulated in to choosing them", "the responsibility lies with those implementing nudges to ensure transparency allowing consumers to retain control over their choices", "if this transparency is ensured then scholars like goodwin need nt be worried the process of nudging can only serve to push individuals towards a common good", "works cited carroll kathryn a et al food bundling as a health nudge investigating consumer fruit and vegetables election using behavioral economics appetite vol",
