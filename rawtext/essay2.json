["19december2023 nudging on the case of personal autonomy the use of nudges in government policy has garnered increased popularity in recent decades oliver", "to nudge is to provide interventions aimed at influencing the behaviour of an individual while preserving freedom of choice", "a speed limit is not a nudge but a form of direct regulation there is a hard incentive to remain within safe speeds", "a speed display board however may be considered a nudge as they work to guide a driver to safe driving speeds without altering the economic incentives of speeding or restrict the choice to violate regulations", "a nudge must be cheap and easy to avoid kuyerandgordijn", "any situation which requires a choice operates under an architecture a framework that presents the ideas", "changes in the choice architecture affects the outcome of decision making for example the ordering of choices matter if people see certain items first they are more likely to buy them sunstein", "on this basis its important to question the degree in which choice architecture and nudging influences behaviour", "the principle of nudge theory has gained widespread acceptance in governments and policy decisions as methods to maximize societal gains however it has not been immune to criticism", "influencing public opinion comes with the ethical considerations that there may be violations of autonomy", "its true that nudges can limit the autonomy in decision making either through time restrictions or taking advantage of judgement heuristics", "however with most methods of nudging proper capacity for reason allows an individual to regain their sense of agency", "ethical implications of autonomy only arise if the nudging practices exploit the ability to effectively perform reflective reasoning", "nudges aimed at deliberately supplying information and enhance reflective decision making are respectful of the full autonomy of an individual however limitations in autonomy arise in the context of time management", "its important to distinguish that humans are not fully rational creatures instead we operate the processing of information under two distinct systems system 1 is fast automatic relying on various judgmental heuristics to inform decisions system 2isslow reflective and calculative sunstein", "educative nudges are aimed to increase system 2 thinking", "most can readily agree that there limited ethical implications when it comes to educative nudging in fact most educative nudging practices promote a choice architecture that requires an active choosing strategy free from any directional influence baldwin", "voting ballots provide information on candidates to increase reflective thinking in decision making", "however limitations in autonomy fall under the usage limits of system 2", "deliberate thinking is slow and time consuming", "the effectiveness of educative nudges is reliant on the willingness to engage in slower thought processes", "one can not assume that there is a necessity to become informed on all underlying issues we would get overwhelmed with choice", "time plays a constraint on autonomy deciding on everything limits the attention on matters that are most important", "information overload can lead to decision fatigue where we often fall back on simpler heuristic based decision spichertandkatsikopoulos", "educative nudges aim to promote rational thinking however to prevent the tiring of our system 2manynudges are often reliant on our system 1 thinking", "these dont exist without their consequences though", "nudges aimed to covertly bypass the conscious awareness by taking advantage of a persons irrationality can be viewed as ethical violations of a persons self agency", "a great deal of nudges operates under the tendency to target system 1 thinking", "take for example setting a default option organ donation rates typically exceed 90inoptout countries compared to 15inopt in countries mackay and robinson", "setting a default is a nudge because it changes the choice architecture to favor more the option that is preselected this method of influence is driven by system 1 behaviour which exploits the status quo bias", "from this perspective a default prevents adequate reasoning and deliberate choice and therefore acts to limit the autonomy of an individual by taking advantage of their irrational behaviour baldwin", "reliance on subconscious thinking is not necessarily a breach of autonomy if the outcomes achieved align with an individual score values", "as thaler and sunstein argue nudges should mainly aim to influence choices in a way that will make chooser better off as judged by themselves thaler and sunstein", "nudges are aimed to influence irrational behaviour in a way that aligns with someones fully rational choice", "it is nevertheless the case that the influence of nudges of this type are easy to shake off", "these nudges aim to only target system 1 thinking", "with proper reflection it becomes noticeable that a nudge has been administered", "in addition resistance to these nudges become more realized the more the intervention goes against your reasons engelen an anti donor individual in an opt out country will experience some form dissonance with the nudging intervention and just easily opt out", "nudges of this type are meant to help irrational decision making without infringing capabilities to make deliberate informed choices", "the most dangerous methods of nudging are those that influence decision making in a way that resists a persons capacity for reason", "this method of nudging often alters the choice architect to heavily favour a decision by blocking reflection or subverting the understanding of preferences", "this type of nudge most often attempts to get an individual to choose what the influencers best interest is rather than their own", "consider the framing effect of environmental policies framing a consequence of environmentally relevant decision as a loss that must be prevented increases likelihood of behavioral change roprethomarandkneevicvel bar", "by structuring the debate around the loss of habitat rather than the gain from environmental conservation", "the manipulative aspect of loss a version lies in its ability to exploit deliberative thinking instead aiming to exploit pathos such as guilt shame and fear roprethomarandkneevicvel bar", "this nudge approach while aiming to maximize social welfare can be considered an ethical violation on personal autonomy as it prevents rational thinking through the use of charged emotions", "the feasibility to resist choosing against the nudge becomes dependent on the capacity in which you can control a rational forces", "reflective thinking on the topic is not based on reason yet one motion", "in this sense framing effects or any type of nudge that aims to deliberately impede well rationed reason can constitute an ethical violation and a personal loss of autonomy that may be hard to reflectively understand", "works cited baldwin robert", "from regulation to behaviour change giving nudge the third degree the modern law review vol", "77no", "62014pp", "831857doi10",
