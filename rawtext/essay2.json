["December 2023\n \nNudging on the case of Personal Autonomy \n The use of \u2018nudges\u2019 in government policy has ga rnered increased popularity in recent \ndecades (Oliver).", "To \u2018nudge\u2019 is to provide interventions ai med at influencing the behaviour of an \nindividual while preserving freedom of choice .", "A speed limit is not a nudge  but a form of direct \nregulation: there is a hard incentive to remain within safe speeds .", "A speed display board, \nhowever, may be considered a nudge as they work to guide a driver to safe driving speeds \nwithout altering the economic in centives of speeding or restrict the choice to violate regulations.", "A nudge must be ch eap and easy to avoid (Kuyer and Gordijn) .Any situation which  requires a \nchoice operates under an architecture: a framework that presents the ideas.", "Changes in the choice \narchitecture affects the outcome  of decision making; For example, the ordering of choices \nmatter; if people see certain items first, they are more likel y to buy them (Sunstein).", "On this \nbasis, it\u2019s important to question the degree in which choice architecture and nudging  influences \nbehaviour.", "The principle of nudge theory has gained widespread acceptance in  governments and \npolicy decisions as methods to maximize societal gains; however, it has not been immune to \ncriticism.", "Influencing public opinion comes with the ethi cal considerations that there may be \nviolations of autonomy.", "It\u2019s true that nudges can limit the autonomy in decision-making, either \nthrough time-restrictions or taking advantage of judgement heuristics.", "However, with most \nmethods of nudging,  proper capacity for r eason allows an individual to regain their sense of \nagency.", "Ethical implications o f autonomy only arise if the nudging practices exploit the ability to \neffectively perform reflective reasoning.", "Nudges aimed at deli berately supplying information  and enhance reflective decision-\nmaking are respectful of the full autonomy of an indiv idual, however, limitations in autonomy \narise in the context of time -management.", "It\u2019s important to distinguish that humans are not fully \nrational creatures, instead we operate the processing of information under  two distinct systems: \nSystem 1 is fast, automatic, relying on various judgmental heuristics to inform decisions; System \n2 is slow, reflective, and calculative  (Sunstein).", "Educative nudges are aimed to increase System 2 \nthinking.", "Most can readily agree that there limited ethical implications when it comes to \neducative nudging; In fact, most educative nudging practices promote a choice architecture that \nrequires an active choosing strategy free from any directional influence  (Baldwin).", "V oting ballots \nprovide information on candidates to increase reflective thinking in decision making.Ho wever, \nlimitations in autonomy fall under the usage limits of System 2.", "Deliberate thinking is slow and \ntime-consuming.The effectiveness of educati ve nudges is reliant on the willingness to engage in \nslower thought processes.", "One cannot assume that there is  a necessity to become informed on all \nunderlying issues: we would get overwhelmed with choice !Time plays a constraint on \nautonomy; deciding on everything limits the attention on matters that are most important.", "Information overload can lead to decision -fatigue, where we often fall back on simpler he uristic-\nbased decisions (Pichert and Katsikopoulos) .", "Educative nudges aim to promote rational thinking, \nhowever, to prevent the tiring of our System 2, many nudges are often reliant on our system 1 \nthinking.These don\u2019t exist without their consequences though.", "Nudges aimed to covertly bypass the conscious awareness by taking advantage of a \nperson\u2019s irrationality can be viewed as ethical violations of a person\u2019s self-agency.", "A great deal of \nnudges operates under the tendency to target system 1 thinking.", "Take for example setting a \ndefault option; Organ donation rates typically exceed 90% in opt-out countries compared to 15%  \n \nin opt-in countries (MacKay and Robinson) .", "Setting a default is a nudge because it changes the \nchoice architecture to favor more the option that is pre-selected; this method of influence is \ndriven by system-1 behaviour which exploits the status-quo bias.", "From this perspective, a default \nprevents adequate reasoning and deliberate choice and therefore acts to limit the autonomy of a n \nindividual by taking advantage of their irratio nal behaviour (Baldwin).", "Reliance on subconscious \nthinking is not necessarily a breach of autonomy  if the outcomes achieved ali gn with an \nindividual\u2019s core values.", "As Thaler and Sunstein  argue, nudges should mainly a im \u201cto influence \nchoices in a way that will make chooser better off, as judged by themselves \u201d (Thaler and \nSunstein).", "Nudges are aimed to influence irrational behaviour in a way that aligns with \nsomeone\u2019s fully rational choice .", "It is, nevertheless, the case that  the influence of nudges of this \ntype are easy to shake off.These nudges aim to only target System 1 thinking.", "With proper \nreflection, it becomes noticeable that a nudge has been administered.", "In addition, resistance to \nthese nudges become more realized the more the intervention goes against your reasons  \n(Engelen); an anti-donor individual in an opt-out country will experience some form dissonance \nwith the nudging intervention  and just easily opt-out.", "Nudges of this type are meant to help \nirrational decision-making without infringing capabilities to make deliberate, informed choices .", "The most dangerous method s of nudging are those that influence decision-making in a \nway that resists a person\u2019s capacity for reason .", "This method of nudging often alters the choice \narchitect to heavily favour a decision by blocking reflection or subverting the understanding of \npreferences.", "This type of nudge most often attempts to get an individual to choose what the \ninfluencer\u2019s best interest is, rather than the ir own.", "Consider the framing effect of environmental \npolicies; framing a consequence of environmentally relevant  decision as a loss that must be \nprevented increases likelihood of behavioral change (Ropret Homar and Kne\u017eevi\u0107 Cvelbar) .", "By  \n \nstructuring the debate around the los s of habitat rather than the gain from environmental \nconservation.", "The manipulative aspect of loss aversion lies in its ability to exploit deliberative \nthinking, instead aiming to exploit pathos\u2014 such as guilt, shame, and fear (Ropret Homar and \nKne\u017eevi\u0107 Cvelbar).", "This nudge approach, while aiming to maximize social welfare, can be \nconsidered an ethical violation on personal autonomy  as it prevents rational thinking through the \nuse of charged emotions.", "The feasibility to resist choosing against the nudge beco mes dependent \non the capacity in which you can control arational forces.Reflective thinking on the topic is not \nbased on reason, yet on emotion.", "In this sense, framing effects or any type of nudge that aim s to \ndeliberately impede well rationed reason can constitute an ethical violation and a personal loss of \nautonomy that may be hard to reflectively understand.", "Works Cited: \n \nBaldwin, Robert.\u201cFrom Regulation to Behaviour Change: Giving Nudge the Third Degree.\u201d The \nModern Law Review , vol.77, no.", "6, 2014, pp.831 \u2013857, doi:10.1111/1468 -2230.12094.Engelen, Bart.", "\u201cNudging and Rationality: What Is There to Worry?\u201d Rationality and Society , vol.31, no.2, 2019, pp.", "204 \u2013232, doi:10.1177/1043463119846743.Kuyer, Paul, and Bert Gordijn.", "\u201cNudge in Perspective: A Systematic Literature Review on the \nEthical Issues with Nudging.\u201d Rationality and Society , vol.35, no.2, 2023, pp.", "191 \u2013230, \ndoi:10.1177/10434631231155005.MacKay, Douglas, and Alexandra Robinson.", "\u201cThe Ethics of Organ Donor Registration Policies: \nNudges and Respect for Autonomy.\u201d The American Journal of Bioethics , vol.16, no.11, \n2016, pp.", "3\u201312, doi:10.1080/15265161.2016.1222007.Oliver, Adam.", "\u201cNudging, Shoving, and Budging: Behavioural Economic\u2010informed Policy.\u201d \nPublic Administration , vol.93, no.3, 2015, pp.", "700 \u2013714, doi:10.1111/padm.12165.Pichert, Daniel, and Konstantinos V.
