["ethical implication of nudges introduction nudging as a term became popular because of richard thaler s book nudge", "a nudge is any deliberate structuring of choices that can predict behavior", "the nudge makes decisions easier without removing any options", "choice architecture change show a decision maker perceives options", "for example changing a tipping system to default the consumer paying 20 gratuity", "this creates more tips than the old system where default is tipping 0zarrabian2019", "the new choice makes a person feel that they take something away from the server instead of giving something extra", "individual autonomy can be defined by the quality or state of being self governing merriam webster or as freedom from external control or influences oxford languages", "if we define it this way nudging breaches autonomy but is good if benefits outweigh costs", "this essay discusses the intent and ethics behind creating choices", "background and theory maximizing freedom of choice while encouraging options to benefit society is the basis of both a nudge and libertarian paternalism thaler and sunstein 2008", "libertarians believe that an individual should have utmost freedom of choice", "paterna lists are skeptical if true freedom of choice exists and they might think that it never will", "when thaler and sunstein 2008 coined the term libertarian paterna lists many thought the oxymoronic title was strange", "in their research they changed the ways options were presented to affect behavior", "one example was their smart savings plan", "the problem they addressed was simple employees were not saving enough money", "the employers thought their 401k savings plan was enough to incentivize saving but they were wrong", "the paradox of choices or too many choices prevented this", "the plan was complex with 100sof option for investments and savings rate with a very low default savings rate", "thaler and sunstein 2008 proposed a plan that would smooth out the process to help people make better decisions and promote good habits for the employees", "they achieved this by raising the default savings rate and made the options for funds bonds more condensed so there were fewer options per page", "they found that this simple change encouraged more saving since most people didnt change from the default saving rate", "2008 to consider the ethical implications of this did the change of system and presentation of options infringe on employees autonomy", "yes it did", "however it encouraged behaviors that would benefit employees", "this is the ethical dilemma is decreasing someones autonomy worth the benefit derived from the nudge", "analysis of nudging and autonomy true individual autonomy is defined as a freedom from external control or influences", "no human has 100 autonomy", "autonomy does not exist in a binary state rather it exists on a continuum", "the question is not whether someone is autonomous or not but how much autonomy they have", "when the united states wanted autonomy from britain they fought a war for their independence", "when they won they traded some of that freedom and agency for greater government intervention and services that most agreed would help society", "with this example the us lowered its autonomy but still derived benefits", "nudges fundamentally reduce an individuals autonomy when deciding", "if the outcome of the nudge benefits the individual or society it can be a good thing", "a nudge is an application of choice architecture", "influence and persuasion will never be eliminated from choice architecture", "the goal should be to help people make informed decisions while maintaining their autonomy", "societal effects of nudging if we use the dictionary definitions of individual autonomy as freedom from external control and influence nudging violates autonomy", "since nudging changes the perception of a choice this creates outside influence of a decision", "if these decisions were truly free of external influence people would realize how heuristics and influence help them tverskykahn1974", "a decision without external influence or control would look very complex", "every choice laid out randomly with no sorting criteria and hundreds and thousands of options", "the decision fatigue this would create would make humans far less efficient", "people would spend lots of time on small and menial decisions", "no human is completely autonomous", "there are certain groups that have more autonomy than others", "for example the us has freedoms that apply to all citizens that most countries do not allow", "speech press assembly and fair trial rights allow people more autonomy", "at the same time the us also agreed that they would all vote for leaders to make decisions for them", "this is giving up autonomy", "by giving up some autonomy the society was better off since it freed time and attention", "people could now focus to contribute labor and create businesses", "this helped build the country", "this is an example of how giving up autonomy can be a positive for the collective welfare of peoples", "lets discuss another example better grades", "a common pitfall of college students are low grades", "a lack of awareness of grades until the end of the semester is to blame", "when they start looking at their grades they see they need to make a change", "when they do its too late to have a large positive impact on the grades", "ben smith and 3 researchers ran a trial to see if nudges created better outcomes in class smith 2018", "they set up a random experiment that sent nudges in the form of a message at the bottom of assignments and in emails", "the nudge was a script that read hi name as of now you have an grade in the class", "this assignment is worth points points", "if you get more than x on this assignment your class grade will increase to an higher grade", "if you get less than y on this assignment your grade will drop at least one grade", "not doing the assignment will result in an lower grade smith 2018", "each of the tailored messages were filled in with the students data", "the researchers found statistical evidence that the class that was nudged performed better", "in this case the nudge caused no infringement and had a large benefit", "a perfect nudge", "another example social media", "to access social media websites one needs to agree to terms of service", "these terms are available for people to read and access but the problem is how they display it", "some put the agreement in a very small text box and make the 100 page document fit into a small window", "they then put a checkmark at the bottom of the box that you read and accepted terms", "most people will try to read some of the large agreement but will stop once they realize how much they must read jones 2005", "the goal create confusion about what the customer is agreeing to", "when customers agree to the terms they sign away the right to privacy", "this allows companies to use collect and share their personal data", "the choice architecture was set up in a way that made not reading the agreement more attractive", "the customers dont realize that they signed away their data privacy", "this nudge created less work to read the document and a negative for the unaware customer", "ethical discussion in the previous sections the essay outlined some ethical concerns with nudging", "nudging infringes on autonomy but is justified if benefit is large compared to costs", "simple", "the logic can be simple but measuring the benefits and costs of a nudge is challenging", "take for example the social media nudges", "they nudged people into agreeing to terms of service without full understanding", "some might argue that having access to the platform connects humans in ways they can never achieve without it", "that can be a great benefit to a lot of people", "on the other hand the costs of data privacy are immense", "this cost is harder to measure since once you agree to have your data collected and shared you dont know what they do with it", "one could argue that the negative effects of data collection outweigh the positive social aspects of online communities", "the ethical conversation shifts from individual autonomy and data privacy to common welfare", "does punishing these platforms that create millions of jobs and contribute the most to economies and worth data privacy", "this is very hard to answer", "it calls into question if the benefit that is measured for the common people or individual autonomy", "essentially does someones privacy matter more than the common peoples benefit", "transparency and informed consent can be a way to solve this dilemma", "in2021jonaswachnerand3 others decided to test the effectiveness of nudges with disclosures", "they wanted to see if a nudge still worked if the intent was made known", "they created a nudge at a kiosk which made healthier options more salient to drive healthier eating", "different groups were informed of the intent or they were not", "what they found is that satisfaction and autonomy was protected even if intent was shared wachner2021", "what this means is that even if autonomy is breached people do not perceive it that way", "social media companies can use this to promote more ethics", "they can put a summary of the key points of data privacy right next to the button to make it salient", "conclusion in conclusion nudges infringe on autonomy but are justified if benefits outweigh costs", "this holds true if you evaluate costs benefits to collective welfare or individuals", "policy makers must consider how they impact individuals or the collective welfare", "to serve communities they must measure all explicit and implicit costs", "then compare this to the benefits a policy will produce or they think will produce", "will there ever be a perfect equilibrium of autonomy and social welfare", "no", "knowing this policy makers must always ask all end users feedback", "with a large enough sample size they can predict how much of common welfare can be affected",
