["Ethical Implication of Nudges  \nIntroduction \nNudging as a term becam e popular becaus e of Richard Thaler\u2019s book, \u201c Nudge \u201d.", "A nudg e is any \ndeliberat e structuring of choices that can predict behavior.The nudg e makes decisions easier without \nremoving any options.", "Choic e architectur e changes how a decision maker perceives options.For \nexample, changing a tipping system to default the consumer paying 20% gratuity.", "This creates mor e tips \nthan the old system where default is tipping 0% (Zarrabian, 2019) .", "The new choic e makes a person feel \nthat they take something away from the server instead of giving something extra.", "Individua l autonomy \ncan be defined by the quality or stat e of being self-governing (Merriam Webster) or as freedom from \nexternal contro l or influences (Oxford Languages).", "If we defin e it this way, nudging breaches autonomy \nbut is good if benefits outweigh costs.This essay discusses the intent and ethics behind creating choices.", "Background and Theory \nMaximizing freedom of choice whil e encouraging options to benefit society is the basis of both a \nnudg e and Libertarian Paternalism (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008 ).", "Libertarians believe that an individual \nshould have utmost freedom of choice.Paternalists ar e skeptical if true freedom of choic e exists, and \nthey might think that it never will.", "When Thaler and Sunstein (2 008) coined the term Libertarian \nPaternalists, many thought the oxymoronic title was strange.", "In their research they changed the ways \noptions were presented to affect behavio r. On e example was their SMarT savings plan.Th e problem they \naddressed was simple: employees wer e not saving enough money.", "Th e employers thought their 401(k) \nsavings plan was enough to incentiviz e saving but they were wrong.The paradox of choices or too many \nchoices prevented this.", "The plan was complex with 100s of option for investments and savings rat e with  \na very low default savings rate.", "Thaler and Sunstein  (2008) proposed a plan that would smooth out the \nprocess to help people make better decisions and promote good habits for the employees.", "They \nachieved this by raising  the default savings rate and made the options for funds/bonds more condensed \nso there were fewer options per page.", "They found that this simple change encouraged more saving since \nmost people didn\u2019t change from the default saving rate.", "(2008) T o consider the ethical implications of \nthis, did the change of system and presentation of options infringe on employees\u2019 autonomy?Yes, it did.However, it encouraged behaviors that would benefit employees.", "This is the ethical dilemma:  is \ndecreasing someone\u2019s autonomy worth the benefit derived from the nudge?", "Analysis of Nudging and Autonomy  \nTrue Individual autonomy is defined as a freedom from external control or influences.No human \nhas 100% autonomy.", "Autonomy does not exist in a binary state, rather, it exists on a continuum.The \nquestion is not whether someone is autonomous or not, but how much autonomy they have.", "When the \nUnited States wanted autonomy from Britain, they fought a war for their independence.When they \nwon, they traded some of that freedom and agency for greater government intervention and services \nthat most agreed would help society.", "With this example, the US lowered its autonomy but still derived \nbenefits.Nudges fundamentally reduce an individual\u2019s autonomy when deciding.", "If the outcome of the \nnudge benefits the individual or society, it can be a good thing.A nudge is an application of choice \narchitecture.Influence and persuasion will never be eliminated from choice architecture.", "The goal \nshould be to help people make informed decisions while maintaining their autonomy.", "Societal effects  of nudging  \nIf we use the dictionary definitions of individual autonomy as freedom from external control and \ninfluence, nudging violates autonomy.", "Since nudging changes the perception of a choice, this creates \noutside influence of a decision.", "If these decisions were truly free of external influence, people would \nrealize how heuristics and influence help them (Tversky& Kahn ,1974) .A decision without external \ninfluence or control would look very complex.", "Every choice laid out randomly with no sorting criteria \nand hundreds and thousands of options.The decision fatigue this would create would make humans far \nless efficient.People would spend lots of time on small and menial decisions.", "No human is completely \nautonomous.There are certain groups that have more autonomy than others.For example, the US has \nfreedoms that apply to all citizens that most countries do not allow.", "Speech, Press, Assembly and fair \ntrial rights allow people more autonomy.At the same time, the US also agreed that they would all vote \nfor leaders to make decisions for them.This is giving up autonomy.", "By giving up some autonomy, the \nsociety was better off since it freed time and attention.People could now focus to contribute labor and \ncreate businesses.This helped build the country.", "This is an example of how giving up autonomy can be a \npositive for the collective welfare of peoples.Let\u2019s discuss another example, better grades.A common pitfall of college students are low \ngrades.", "A lack of awareness of grades until the end of the semester is to blame.When they start looking \nat their grades, they see they need to make a change.", "When they do, it's too late to have a large positive \nimpact on the grades.Ben Smith and 3 researchers ran a trial to see if nudges created better outcomes \nin class (Smith, 2018).", "They set up a random experiment that sent nudges in the form of a message at \nthe b ottom of assignments and in emails.", "The nudge was a script that read,\u201d Hi [Name], As of now, you \nhave a(n) [Grade] in the class.This assignment is worth [Points] points.", "If you get more than [X] on this \nassignment, your class grade will increase to a(n) [Higher Grade].", "If you get less than [Y] on this \nassignment, your grade will drop at least one grade.Not doing the assignment will result in a(n) [Lower \nGrade]\u201d (Smith, 2018).", "Each of the tailored messages were filled in with the student\u2019s data.The  \nresearchers found statistical evidence that the class that was nudged performed better.", "In this case, the \nnudge caused no infringement and had a large benefit.A perfect nudge.Another example, social media.To access social media websites, one needs to  agree to terms of \nservice.", "These terms are available for people to read and access but the problem is how they display it.Some put the agreement in a very small text box and make the 100+ page document fit into a small \nwindow.", "They then put a check mark at the bottom of the box that you read and accepted terms.", "Most \npeople will try to read some of the large agreement but will stop once they realize how much they must \nread  (Jones 2005) .The goal: create confusion about what the customer is agreeing to.", "When customers \nagree to the terms, they sign away the right to privacy.This allows companies to use, collect and share \ntheir personal data.", "The choice architecture was set up in a way that made not reading the agreement \nmore attractive.The customers don't realize that they signed away their data privacy.", "This nudge \ncreated less work to read the document and a negative for the unaware customer.Ethical Discussion  \nIn the previous sections, the essay outlined some ethical concerns with nudging.", "Nudging \ninfringes on autonomy but is justified if benefit is large compared to costs.Simple.The logic can be \nsimple but measuring the benefits and costs of a nudge is challenging.", "Take for example the social media \nnudges.They nudged people into agreeing to terms of service without full understanding.Some might \nargue that having access to the platform connects humans in ways they can never achieve without it.", "That can be a great benefit to a lot of people.On the other hand, the costs of data privacy are immense.", "This cost is harder to measure since once you agree to have your data collected and shared, you don\u2019t \nknow what they do with it.", "One could argue that the negative effects of data collection outweigh the \npositive social aspects of online communities.The ethical conversation shifts from individual autonomy and data privacy to common welfare.", "Does punishing these platforms that create millions of jobs, and contribute the most to economies and \nworth data privacy?This is very hard to answer.It calls into question if the benefit that is measured for \nthe common people or individual autonomy.", "Essentially, does someone\u2019s privacy matter more than the \ncommon people\u2019s benefit?Transparency and informed consent can be a way to solve this dilemma.", "In 2021, Jonas Wachner \nand 3 others decided to test the effectiveness of nudges with disclosures.They wanted to see if a nudge \nstill worked if the intent was made known.", "They created a nudge at a kiosk which made healthier \noptions more salient to drive healthier eating.Different groups were informed of the intent, or they \nwere not.", "What they found is that satisfaction and autonomy was protected even if intent was shared \n(Wachner,  2021).What this means is that even if autonomy is breached, people do not perceive it that \nway.", "Social media companies can use this to promote more ethics.They can put a summary of the key \npoints of data privacy right next to the button to make it salient.", "Conclusion  \nIn conclusion, nudges infringe on autonomy but are justified if benefits outweigh costs.This holds true if \nyou evaluate costs/benefits to collective welfare or individuals.", "Policy makers must consider how they impact individuals or the collective welfare.To serve \ncommunities they must measure all explicit and implicit costs.Then compare this to the benefits a policy \nwill produce, or they think will produce.", "Will there ever be a perfect equilibrium of autonomy and social \nwelfare?No.knowing this, policy makers must always ask all end users\u2019 feedback.", "With a large enough \nsample size, they can predict how much of common welfare can be affected.Lots of data and ethical \nconversations, nudges can change the world.References  \nBen O .", "Smit h, Dustin R .Whit
