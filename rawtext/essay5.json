["the ethical implications of nudge through its different forms nudging is prevalent on both smaller levels such as in businesses and grocery stores and bigger levels such as in healthcare and the government", "nudging which refers to any form of the way choices are presented that can affect peoples decision making without confining the number of choices is used in different ways to influence peoples behavior", "there are numerous strengths and weaknesses to nudging", "one of its main strengths is that it is cost effective and easy to implement", "unlike many government regulations that are costly and take time to be effective the impacts of nudging can be seen immediately and can cost almost nothing", "one example of this is in grocery stores", "to promote eating healthier foods grocery stores may place healthier food options at eye level to make it easier for consumers", "as a result consumers are more inclined to buy these options because of the way they are presented", "this form of nudging by grocery stores is simply them moving products around but can be as effective as advertisements and other forms of promotion", "another strength of nudging is that people tend to accept nudges relatively quickly as long as they help promote similar goals", "this is different from other regulations like tax policies and fines which are heavily criticized and not viewed favorably by people", "for example in the workplace managers and leaders can send alerts to encourage physical activity or have fitness challenges amongst colleagues", "the purpose of these nudges is to get workers to exercise more which aligns with the goals of the workers", "due to the similar interests workers would accept and encourage certain nudges", "one weakness of nudging is that it could lead to in genuine decision making because peoples choices are being influenced by other peoples desires", "nudging is a way for one person to influence another persons decision which could lead people to feel trapped into making a certain decision that may go against their own", "one example of this is in healthcare", "to promote getting vaccinated healthcare companies may send constant text messages and emails to people telling them to get vaccinated", "the constant bombardment of reminders may force people into feeling as if they have to get the vaccine even if it goes against their beliefs", "nudging can play a role in altering peoples beliefs and forcing people into societal norms", "another weakness of nudging is that it can be used for manipulation", "the reason for this is that nudges can be misleading and un transparent", "for example newspaper companies and magazines offer free monthly trials to lure consumers into utilizing their products", "however as stated in the fine print at the end of the monthly trial consumers are automatically fully subscribed and would have to pay full price", "by offering the free monthly trial magazine and newspaper companies are manipulating their consumers in to fully subscribing because of their lack of transparency", "manipulation in nudging is one of the biggest reasons why nudging s ethicality is questionable", "as stated above nudging allows companies to not be fully transparent which confuses consumers and tricks them into making poor decisions", "another reason why nudging can be unethical is because people feel nudging intrudes on their autonomy and violates their right to self govern and make their own decisions", "governments and healthcare companies that use nudging can put significant pressure on people to have certain beliefs and make certain decisions which allows the government to take control of people and goes against their right to autonomy", "also nudging instigates people to utilize their type 1 processes of making intuitive and impulsive decisions", "this could lead people to make decisions they would regret had they had time for reflection and critical thinking", "utilizing nudging unethically can lead to consumers making decisions based solely on intuition and deception", "in order to limit the ethical ambiguity of nudging nudging should only be used to promote welfare and not be used for manipulation", "welfare in nudging is when nudging is only used to advocate for mutually shared goals such as people getting in shape or eating healthier foods", "manipulation in nudging is when nudging is used to promote one sided goals such as getting vaccinated or subscribing to a newspaper company", "this involves a lack of transparency between one party to another and can be deceiving to consumers", "it can also infringe on their freedom and right to choice", "currently nudging is both good and bad because of the way it is utilized in society", "to utilize nudging only to promote welfare companies should be forced to make nudges more transparent so people are aware of the purpose behind the nudging", "this will ensure that peoples decisions are their own and not ones that are completely influenced by other peoples desires", "also nudging should never infringe on peoples right to choice because if this were the case society would be uniform with everybody having similar beliefs and performing similar actions", "by making nudging more transparent without restricting peoples right to transparency society can transition from nudges being used for manipulation to nudges being used for the common good"]
