Ethical Implication of Nudges  
Introduction 
Nudging as a term becam e popular becaus e of Richard Thaler’s book, “ Nudge ”.
--------------------------------------------------

A nudg e is any 
deliberat e structuring of choices that can predict behavior.The nudg e makes decisions easier without 
removing any options.
--------------------------------------------------

Choic e architectur e changes how a decision maker perceives options.For 
example, changing a tipping system to default the consumer paying 20% gratuity.
--------------------------------------------------

This creates mor e tips 
than the old system where default is tipping 0% (Zarrabian, 2019) .
--------------------------------------------------

The new choic e makes a person feel 
that they take something away from the server instead of giving something extra.
--------------------------------------------------

Individua l autonomy 
can be defined by the quality or stat e of being self-governing (Merriam Webster) or as freedom from 
external contro l or influences (Oxford Languages).
--------------------------------------------------

If we defin e it this way, nudging breaches autonomy 
but is good if benefits outweigh costs.This essay discusses the intent and ethics behind creating choices.
--------------------------------------------------

Background and Theory 
Maximizing freedom of choice whil e encouraging options to benefit society is the basis of both a 
nudg e and Libertarian Paternalism (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008 ).
--------------------------------------------------

Libertarians believe that an individual 
should have utmost freedom of choice.Paternalists ar e skeptical if true freedom of choic e exists, and 
they might think that it never will.
--------------------------------------------------

When Thaler and Sunstein (2 008) coined the term Libertarian 
Paternalists, many thought the oxymoronic title was strange.
--------------------------------------------------

In their research they changed the ways 
options were presented to affect behavio r. On e example was their SMarT savings plan.Th e problem they 
addressed was simple: employees wer e not saving enough money.
--------------------------------------------------

Th e employers thought their 401(k) 
savings plan was enough to incentiviz e saving but they were wrong.The paradox of choices or too many 
choices prevented this.
--------------------------------------------------

The plan was complex with 100s of option for investments and savings rat e with  
a very low default savings rate.
--------------------------------------------------

Thaler and Sunstein  (2008) proposed a plan that would smooth out the 
process to help people make better decisions and promote good habits for the employees.
--------------------------------------------------

They 
achieved this by raising  the default savings rate and made the options for funds/bonds more condensed 
so there were fewer options per page.
--------------------------------------------------

They found that this simple change encouraged more saving since 
most people didn’t change from the default saving rate.
--------------------------------------------------

(2008) T o consider the ethical implications of 
this, did the change of system and presentation of options infringe on employees’ autonomy?Yes, it did.However, it encouraged behaviors that would benefit employees.
--------------------------------------------------

This is the ethical dilemma:  is 
decreasing someone’s autonomy worth the benefit derived from the nudge?
--------------------------------------------------

Analysis of Nudging and Autonomy  
True Individual autonomy is defined as a freedom from external control or influences.No human 
has 100% autonomy.
--------------------------------------------------

Autonomy does not exist in a binary state, rather, it exists on a continuum.The 
question is not whether someone is autonomous or not, but how much autonomy they have.
--------------------------------------------------

When the 
United States wanted autonomy from Britain, they fought a war for their independence.When they 
won, they traded some of that freedom and agency for greater government intervention and services 
that most agreed would help society.
--------------------------------------------------

With this example, the US lowered its autonomy but still derived 
benefits.Nudges fundamentally reduce an individual’s autonomy when deciding.
--------------------------------------------------

If the outcome of the 
nudge benefits the individual or society, it can be a good thing.A nudge is an application of choice 
architecture.Influence and persuasion will never be eliminated from choice architecture.
--------------------------------------------------

The goal 
should be to help people make informed decisions while maintaining their autonomy.
--------------------------------------------------

Societal effects  of nudging  
If we use the dictionary definitions of individual autonomy as freedom from external control and 
influence, nudging violates autonomy.
--------------------------------------------------

Since nudging changes the perception of a choice, this creates 
outside influence of a decision.
--------------------------------------------------

If these decisions were truly free of external influence, people would 
realize how heuristics and influence help them (Tversky& Kahn ,1974) .A decision without external 
influence or control would look very complex.
--------------------------------------------------

Every choice laid out randomly with no sorting criteria 
and hundreds and thousands of options.The decision fatigue this would create would make humans far 
less efficient.People would spend lots of time on small and menial decisions.
--------------------------------------------------

No human is completely 
autonomous.There are certain groups that have more autonomy than others.For example, the US has 
freedoms that apply to all citizens that most countries do not allow.
--------------------------------------------------

Speech, Press, Assembly and fair 
trial rights allow people more autonomy.At the same time, the US also agreed that they would all vote 
for leaders to make decisions for them.This is giving up autonomy.
--------------------------------------------------

By giving up some autonomy, the 
society was better off since it freed time and attention.People could now focus to contribute labor and 
create businesses.This helped build the country.
--------------------------------------------------

This is an example of how giving up autonomy can be a 
positive for the collective welfare of peoples.Let’s discuss another example, better grades.A common pitfall of college students are low 
grades.
--------------------------------------------------

A lack of awareness of grades until the end of the semester is to blame.When they start looking 
at their grades, they see they need to make a change.
--------------------------------------------------

When they do, it's too late to have a large positive 
impact on the grades.Ben Smith and 3 researchers ran a trial to see if nudges created better outcomes 
in class (Smith, 2018).
--------------------------------------------------

They set up a random experiment that sent nudges in the form of a message at 
the b ottom of assignments and in emails.
--------------------------------------------------

The nudge was a script that read,” Hi [Name], As of now, you 
have a(n) [Grade] in the class.This assignment is worth [Points] points.
--------------------------------------------------

If you get more than [X] on this 
assignment, your class grade will increase to a(n) [Higher Grade].
--------------------------------------------------

If you get less than [Y] on this 
assignment, your grade will drop at least one grade.Not doing the assignment will result in a(n) [Lower 
Grade]” (Smith, 2018).
--------------------------------------------------

Each of the tailored messages were filled in with the student’s data.The  
researchers found statistical evidence that the class that was nudged performed better.
--------------------------------------------------

In this case, the 
nudge caused no infringement and had a large benefit.A perfect nudge.Another example, social media.To access social media websites, one needs to  agree to terms of 
service.
--------------------------------------------------

These terms are available for people to read and access but the problem is how they display it.Some put the agreement in a very small text box and make the 100+ page document fit into a small 
window.
--------------------------------------------------

They then put a check mark at the bottom of the box that you read and accepted terms.
--------------------------------------------------

Most 
people will try to read some of the large agreement but will stop once they realize how much they must 
read  (Jones 2005) .The goal: create confusion about what the customer is agreeing to.
--------------------------------------------------

When customers 
agree to the terms, they sign away the right to privacy.This allows companies to use, collect and share 
their personal data.
--------------------------------------------------

The choice architecture was set up in a way that made not reading the agreement 
more attractive.The customers don't realize that they signed away their data privacy.
--------------------------------------------------

This nudge 
created less work to read the document and a negative for the unaware customer.Ethical Discussion  
In the previous sections, the essay outlined some ethical concerns with nudging.
--------------------------------------------------

Nudging 
infringes on autonomy but is justified if benefit is large compared to costs.Simple.The logic can be 
simple but measuring the benefits and costs of a nudge is challenging.
--------------------------------------------------

Take for example the social media 
nudges.They nudged people into agreeing to terms of service without full understanding.Some might 
argue that having access to the platform connects humans in ways they can never achieve without it.
--------------------------------------------------

That can be a great benefit to a lot of people.On the other hand, the costs of data privacy are immense.
--------------------------------------------------

This cost is harder to measure since once you agree to have your data collected and shared, you don’t 
know what they do with it.
--------------------------------------------------

One could argue that the negative effects of data collection outweigh the 
positive social aspects of online communities.The ethical conversation shifts from individual autonomy and data privacy to common welfare.
--------------------------------------------------

Does punishing these platforms that create millions of jobs, and contribute the most to economies and 
worth data privacy?This is very hard to answer.It calls into question if the benefit that is measured for 
the common people or individual autonomy.
--------------------------------------------------

Essentially, does someone’s privacy matter more than the 
common people’s benefit?Transparency and informed consent can be a way to solve this dilemma.
--------------------------------------------------

In 2021, Jonas Wachner 
and 3 others decided to test the effectiveness of nudges with disclosures.They wanted to see if a nudge 
still worked if the intent was made known.
--------------------------------------------------

They created a nudge at a kiosk which made healthier 
options more salient to drive healthier eating.Different groups were informed of the intent, or they 
were not.
--------------------------------------------------

What they found is that satisfaction and autonomy was protected even if intent was shared 
(Wachner,  2021).What this means is that even if autonomy is breached, people do not perceive it that 
way.
--------------------------------------------------

Social media companies can use this to promote more ethics.They can put a summary of the key 
points of data privacy right next to the button to make it salient.
--------------------------------------------------

Conclusion  
In conclusion, nudges infringe on autonomy but are justified if benefits outweigh costs.This holds true if 
you evaluate costs/benefits to collective welfare or individuals.
--------------------------------------------------

Policy makers must consider how they impact individuals or the collective welfare.To serve 
communities they must measure all explicit and implicit costs.Then compare this to the benefits a policy 
will produce, or they think will produce.
--------------------------------------------------

Will there ever be a perfect equilibrium of autonomy and social 
welfare?No.knowing this, policy makers must always ask all end users’ feedback.
--------------------------------------------------

With a large enough 
sample size, they can predict how much of common welfare can be affected.Lots of data and ethical 
conversations, nudges can change the world.References
