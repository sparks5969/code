["the effects of upsell nudging on society people would like to believe they are in control", "in control of their own lives and futures but most of all their own choices", "however what many dont seem to recognize is that new tactics have arose in order to nudge consumers in the direction suppliers would like", "these suppliers often take the option of choices out of the matter by using specific tactics so that consumers think they are making a decision when really they were nudged in that direction", "the term nudging refers to any aspect of decision making which can influence peoples behaviors in a predictable way without restricting their freedom of choice", "more specifically the concept of upsell nudging is persuading individuals to spend more of their money on certain products in the spur of the moment", "by planting the seed of a suppliers want up sell nudging takes advantage of consumers desires and lack of knowledge", "this is highly unethical as they essentially removed peoples freedom of choice", "and although this can be used to aid the greater good it regularly is not indicating the underlying disregard for personal rights", "robert cialdini provides more insight into the foundation of how consumers fall prey to the psychological factors which induce up selling via his work influence the psychology of persuasion", "one of the main factors cialdini discusses is automatic influence which breaks down into several parts which he refers to as weapons that can trigger the exploitation of human behavior for the enhancement of others sales", "the the most lethal of these weapons is the contrast principle because even the victims themselves tend to see their compliance as determined by the action of natural forces rather than the designs of the person who profits from that compliance cialdini highlighting the subtlety of the principle and its potentially dangerous effect on buyers", "the overall idea states if two items are presented at the same time and the second item is slightly varied from the first then individuals will tend to see a larger discrepancy between those items than what actually is present", "cialdini provides an example of the principle through the lens of retail clothiers", "most clothing stores instruct their sales personnel to sell the more costly items prior to any smaller purchases despite common sense suggesting otherwise", "this is an efficient tactic because when customers are presented with more expensive items first they see accessories as less of a hindrance to their overall purchase", "for instance a man might initially reject the idea of spending 95 for a sweater but if he has just bought a495suit in the store then the 95 sweater will not seem that excessive", "this prime instance of the contrast principle illuminates how easy it is for companies to benefit from subtle up selling without having to spend extra effort trying to convince customers to purchase more", "although the prior example shows nudging as a deceitful tactic that only benefits a single party there are other dimensions in which it could be used to positively influence multiple members of society", "the main issue with the contrast principle is the ability it has to null an individuals autonomy as people tend to make decisions based on a fragmented self", "when the man in the clothier store is flooded with choices in a short amount of time he is being primed to allow his greed to settle in before fully analyzing the purchase and whether or not the 95 sweater is worth the expense", "if consumers can understand the contrast principle through the perspective of social benefit nudging they can allow themselves to make educated decisions that wont be through the lens of a fragmented self and will directly help society", "the term social benefit nudging used by b ovens in his work the ethics of nudge highlights the split desire of individuals when faced with making decisions", "he identifies the importance of understanding an individuals preference and how it can be changed through the effects of nudge", "a major barrier in coercing people to contribute towards social benefits is their own selfish desires and a concern that they will lose their resources", "this can be well noted through the tragedy of the commons society might be better off by refraining from adding a fishing boat to overfished waters or drilling for oil in an oil well that is already depleted but unless i am being compensated or find alternative employment i may be worse off bovens211", "the quote demonstrates that individuals will only give up something for the benefit of others if they have the ability to locate a source to fulfill the loss", "furthermore it also tells that most individuals tend to forget the long run effect that donating to social causes can have on the overall population", "instead their scope of the short run minimizes their desire to be generous towards others for the sake of developing a stronger society and focuses purely on their cost benefits", "on the flip side some people have been able to get over themselves and use nudging effects across many charitable organizations", "for example organizations such as kroger and macys often hold auctions to sell items that can nudge individuals to donate more money to charities", "since consumers will have benefited from either receiving auction items or gaining recognition for donating their own pieces they served their own self interest but also gained the added bonus of feeling good about contributing money to charity", "charities are an extremely effective form of upsell nudging because if individuals donate higher priced items they will raise higher amounts of money", "the importance of these implications lie in whois nudging the individuals to donate items for auction and whether this method of nudging is morally ethical", "despite consumers donating money it is still questionable whether the good outweighs the bad because they may desire the recognition from giving rather than the effect it provides from helping others", "overall the effect of charitable auctions will result in benefits to society but the quality of auction can vary given the preference of cause donors are willing to donate to", "thus why the concept of preference is important when determining nudge factors because the only way for multiple social benefits to occur is to shift enough individual preferences so that they all have a chance to be beneficially impacted", "the contrast principle provides a way for individuals to understand the concept of upsell nudging and provides insight into how society would benefit and function if these types of behaviors and manipulations became the norm", "our society already functions with individuals being nudged towards conceptions about donating to charities and purchasing clothes that they desire", "most individuals follow these paths because they believe them to be the ideal social norm when in reality these views are skewed", "some consumers have a tendency to over think others opinions about them", "this leads them to potentially spend more of their income just to impress others rather than be content with what they actually want", "despite the contrast principles ability to upsell individuals in order for companies to make more money the impact of the principle could be shifted towards a more positive outcome that mutually benefits both parties if people are directed towards products they desire but not at the expense of more money", "similarly charity auctions can be morally questionable because some individuals are specifically donating money to receive items rather than actually having the primary goal of helping fund organizations that provide resources to people in need", "in order to increase the amount of genuine donations certain auctions could do a better job of nudging individuals to donate items towards auctions that they specifically care about in order to incentivize quality empathy for benefitting the people in need", "overall the effectiveness of upsell nudging lies in shaping peoples perception of what they find important in order to maximize the benefit of both parties involved", "as we continue to grow as a society individuals will continue to find more ethical ways to attain these benefits which will result in less in equity between parties", "works cited cialdini robert b", "influence the psychology of persuasion", "harperbusiness 2006", "boven
