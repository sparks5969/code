essay69,"For example, chewing -
gum next to cash register, or putting healthy drink at eyesight level."
essay69,"Nudge  strategies can help people develop habits that are more beneficial to 
themselves and society.For example, placing healthy beverages within sight can help 
people quit carbonated beverages or alcohol and develop health ier lifestyle habits."
essay69,"For example, some banks 
may use word games to attract people to deposit, which may lead to people who have 
not studied finance falling into traps and losing their assets."
essay69,"Another example is about football lottery, which is  something I used to do in my 
Senior high school time ."
essay69,The example in the previous paragraph is a nudge behavior that violates ethics.
essay90,"First, it is important to determine what nudge truly means and to discuss some examples of nudging."
essay90,"Nudging comes in many different forms, but all forms have a goal of steering a person to make a certain, more socially or individually optimal decision.There are some examples of nudge working successfully."
essay90,"One clear example is placing healthier foods at eye level (Schmidt & Engelen p. 2).By placing healthier foods at eye level, people are more likely to choose to eat those foods, which boosts their consumption."
essay90,"Another example of nudging is implementing an opt-out system for organ donation, where the default is for people to donate their organs rather than having a default of not donating organs.(Schmidt & Engelen p.2)."
essay90,"If they are opted out by default, this reduces organ donation, as people are less likely to change from the default option.A final example of nudge is by sending people feedback that compares their energy consumption to their neighbors (Effectiviology)."
essay90,"These are just some examples of nudging being used effectively.There are many different types and example of nudging, but there are also different extents that nudging can be used.This is where the ethical concerns begin to arise."
essay90,"Nudge comes in many different forms, such as presentation of information, changes in physical environment, changes in default, social norms, and commitment."
essay90,"There are examples of nudging being implemented successfully, such as placing healthier foods at the eye level of people who are making decisions on what to buy, or by showing people how much energy they are consuming relative to their neighbors."
essay90,"Retrieved May 4, 2023, from https://effectiviology.com/nudge/#:~:text=Examples%20of%20nudges%20include%20sending,to%20post%20on%20social%20media."
essay4,"However, in this system, any manipulation that alters the individual’s decision-making process (such as nudge) will come at a utility cost."
essay4,"Nudge has several instances of causing people to make better decisions than they otherwise would have.One such example is the Save More Tomorrow program, described in a Journal of Political Economy article by Richard Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi."
essay4,"Since the plan was optional, could be opted out of at any time, and didn’t hide any details, the manipulative cost of this example would be quite low, and so the Save More Tomorrow program ends up being an ethical implementation of nudge."
essay4,"As with the previous example, the manipulative cost of the nudge is low, as it only provides additional information and isn’t obscuring the decision.This results in the nudging of hotel guest’s electricity usage also being ethical."
essay4,"The manipulation cost is a bit larger than the other two examples, though, as people may not take time to look through all their options and assess them properly when they can just buy one of the first few things they see."
essay4,"Since nudge always provides positive utility to society, doesn’t change the payoffs of a decision, and doesn’t obscure information, then based on these three examples, nudge is an ethical tool in shaping decision-making."
essay4,"However, although nudge may be ethical, the mechanisms behind it can easily become unethical.An example is the grocery store from above."
essay4,"One notable example that depends on nudge is gambling, specifically, the lottery."
essay4,"However, the same mechanics that power nudge can also power unethical manipulation, such as the lottery, and there isn’t a simple solution that both allows nudge and disallows such manipulation."

essay102,"The idea behind nudging is to use subtle changes in the environment to influence people's decision-making in ways that promote desirable outcomes.Examples of nudges include default options, social norms, and personalized feedback."
essay102,"This is particularly relevant in the context of public health, as many health challenges, such as obesity and related diseases, have behavioral roots."
essay102,"Nudging can promote financial security through encouraging behaviors such as saving money, paying bills on time, and avoiding high-interest debt."
essay102,"For example, if a food company wants to increase the sales of their unhealthy products.They conduct research and find that people are more likely to buy products that are placed at eye level."
essay102,"For example, imagine that a workplace promotes healthy eating habits by offering discounted healthy meals in the company cafeteria."

essay75,"As the author indicates, for instance, in terms of organ donation, countries

essay75,"Another concern of nudge is that such application will not always guarantee the optimal

(Wang 19)."
essay75,"Application of the nudge will sometimes impose an outcome of inverse direction.For instance, author Robinson conducted an experiment using nudges by offering s tudents an

essay75,"For example, residents who received feedback about their water consumption reduced

essay75,"For example, in terms of organ

essay55,"Thaler

work,
Nudge
,
begins
with
an
example
of
the
changes
in
the
physical
environment
nudge,
although
it
is
fictional
(2008)."
essay55,"Looking
at
the
overall
definition
of
nudge,
it
is
considered
by
founders
Thaler
and
Sunstein
to
be
an
example
of
Libertarian
Paternalism
(Thaler
&
Sunstein,
2008,
p.
5)."
essay55,"So,
when
libertarian
modifies
paternalism,
it
describes
an
action
done
by
a
choice
architect
(for
example,
the
cafeteria
worker
who
rearranged
the
food)
attempting
to
influence
choices
of
individuals,
but
ultimately
the
individual
has
free
will
and
can
decide
against
the
influence."
essay55,"For
example,
it
is
a
societal
norm
for
Americans
to
want
to
be
or gan
donors,
95%
of
Americans
are
in
favor
of
being
an
or gan
donor
(Mullett,
2022)."
essay55,"This
is
an
example
of
the

nudge."
essay55,"Another
example
of
the
societal
norms
nudge
is
the
commercials
that
were
put
out
to
encourage
Covid-19
vaccinations."
essay55,"This
is
an
example
of
presentation
of
information
nudge,
because
theycould
have
said
1

10
Covid

were
people
younger

50,
but
that

not
nudge
the

essay55,"That
is
because
people
can
“re-post”
advertisements,
such
as
the
Covid-19
ads,
to
show
they
are
in

essay55,"One
of

essay55,"Some
of

(Eldridge,

essay15,"Nudging is widely used and if people carefully think about the example of the nudge in daily life, it will be figured out how usual and frequent nudge has been used."
essay15,"For example, if someone is overweight, his parents change his dinner plates to a smaller one, and the unobvious change makes his parents belong to nudge."
essay15,"For the changes in the physical environment, the easiest example has been discussed during the class: in the convenience store, healthier products like milk and yogurt are usually placed at eye level, which would remind and persuade customers to pay more attention to their health."
essay15,"The incentive for the marketer is just to encourage the customer to buy the product, and customers might buy the product on impulse instead of carefully thinking about whether they need the item.It’s different from the first example."
essay15,"For the first example, the convenience store mainly considers customer’s health."
essay15,"For instance, every citizen is supposed to pay our taxes on time, so when the British government intends to remind and nudge citizens to pay their taxes on time by adding the line “most people pay their tax on time” in letters to taxpayers (Halpern and Michael, 2016), it would not relate to the ethical issue."

essay78,"Choice architecture is the design of how choices 
are presented.How a cellphone carrier presents various plans on its website and where a grocery

essay78,"Listing items for sale based on ratings submitted b y other customers is an example of 
herding."
essay78,"In both 
examples about hotel towels and ra ted items above, the bias is in the form of information."
essay78,"A real-life example of this commitment 
nudge is the Save More Tomorrow program."
essay78,"In the wireless plan example above, customers can see that there are 
options and discern that the prominent display of the best value plan means the plan is the 
company’s choice, therefore a disclaimer is not needed."
essay78,"Even less transparent than this wireless 
plan example are subtle nudges whe re people do not realize that they are being nudged."
essay78,"While 
the spirit of nudging requires that nudges be transparent, two examples that T&S themselves 
have used are actually subtle nudges: a grocery store’s placements of items to increase 
consumptions of healthy foods and the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport’s use of a fly image etch ed 
to each urinal to lessen the mess in the restrooms (3-5)."
essay78,"Also, both 
nudges retain other o ptions: people are free to buy other items  or disregard the fly image.Those examples show that lack of transparency is not straightforward."
essay78,"For example, a salesperson influences a frugal customer who needs a basic 
cellphone to purchase a top -of-the-line cellphone with features that the customer does not need."
essay78,"We have to look at the situation case

essay78,"In the wireless plan example above, the choice architect has to design the webpage 
showing the different plans , even if the architect has no intention to  promote a particular plan."
essay78,"In my opinion, this counter argument is  
flawed.We can use the current mortgage rate situation as an example."
essay97,"For example, in their article on nudging and the ethics of behavior change, 
Loewenstein (2019) argues that transparency is essential for maintaining trust and 
respecting autonomy in nudging interventions."
essay97,"For example, a study by S mith and Goldstein (2019) found 
that nudges related to recycling were more effective in individualistic cultures, where 
personal choice and responsibility are emphasized, compared to collectivistic cultures, 
where group harmony and social norms are priorit ized."
essay97,"For example, in some cultures, subtle  interventions may be seen 
as manipulative or disrespectful, while in others, they may be seen as a form of gentle 
persuasion or social influence."
essay97,"For example, in their article on cultural variation in nudging, Bicchieri and Xiao (2019) argue that nudges should be tailored to cultural norms and 
expectations in order to be effective and ethical."
essay97,"For example, Loewenstein (2019) 
argues that nudges should respect individual autonomy and be based on scientific 
evidence, regardless of  cultural norms."
essay97,"Nudges should  be 
tailored to the specific cultural context to be effective and respectful but should also 
respect universal ethical principles such as autonomy and scientific rigor."
essay97,"For 
example, if nudges are designed to promote behaviors that benefit certain groups over 
others, they could be seen as unfair or discriminatory."
essay81,"Some tradiGonal methods of inﬂuencing people's behavior, such as educaGonal acGviGes or punishment, require a lot of money and resources to achieve."

essay19,"People encounter this phenomenon every day, from everyday 
situations such as shopping in the supermarket to important decisions about their own lives, for 
example, whether they want to donate their organs or not."
essay19,"It is very unlikely that people will choose a different option than the default 
afterwards, due to reference-point dependence.A prominent example of using the default rule is 
opt-in or opt-out organ donation."
essay19,"A prominent example of this is  the 
default nudge of the opt-in vs. opt-out approach to organ donation."

essay41,This is not a coincidence but an example of nudging.Nudging is a concept in behavioral economics that indirectly influences our daily decisions.
essay41,"This essay discusses the ethical implications of nudging, for example, exploring the delicate balance between covert manipulation and genuine beneficial guidance."
essay41,"A push to eat healthily, such as putting fruits and vegetables in the front of a store, could unintentionally mislead people about the eating habits of other cultures or disregard the needs of people who follow different diets(Medina, 2021)."
essay41,"Ethical Implications of Nudging   Certain demographic groups, such as adolescents, the elderly, or those from low-income families, may be more susceptible to nudges."
essay41,"It also brings an array of ethical difficulties, such as the potential for manipulation, the effect on personal autonomy, and the requirement for cultural sensitivity."
essay57,"Nudge is increasingly used in public policy to encourage individuals to make healthier, more socially desirable choices, such as quitting smoking or saving money."
essay57,"For example, a hidden nudge might deceive individuals into making choices that are not their own."
essay57,"However, most NCDs can be reduced by targeting four major risk factors: tobacco use, lack of physical activity, harmful use of alcohol, and unhealthy diet (Lin et al., 2017).Take unhealthy diets as an example."
essay57,"The nudges focus on improving how people present information to make food choices, such as providing calorie counts on food menus to draw attention to healthy and unhealthy choices."
essay57,"This nudge helps to help people tend to choose healthy foods.However, freedom of choice is not preserved in the successful examples cited above.They use the hidden nudge because the individual is mainly unconsciously influenced (Lin et al., 2017)."
essay94,"For
instance,
encouraging
individuals
to

money
may
be

as
positive;
however ,

by factors beyond their conscious awareness or control, such as the way choices are presented to 
them."

concept is explained, throughout this paper we will discuss examples of successful nudgin g 
strategies and assess the ethical implications of performing this act."

discuss a particular strategy implemented by employers to help their employees save more 
capital and increase their savings in the long run."

yes, I truly believe this is a very unethical practice, but in a way, not every nudging practice is 
unethical as we saw in one of my examples."

essay99,"However, is such action in and of itself a direct restriction on that individual’s free will, or is it still taking into respect that person’s autonomy?"
essay99,The researchers found that a potential reason for this is that Kazakh students are exposed to an informational video on recycling while UK students do not have such a video.
essay99,"In such a sense, it may be thought that nudging does in fact reduce the autonomy of an individual by not providing an objective, concrete outlook on the situation that presents itself."
essay99,"the intended behavior) rather than as an end in and of themselves (Schmidt & Engelen 2020).However, even though such a concern may be viable, is such an idea truly disrespectful to humanity?"
essay99,Researchers Nys and Engelen discuss this further through the example of a cafeteria deciding where to place its apples and Twinkies that will best incentivize people to choose the healthier option.
essay99,"Even though such a tactic does utilize non-rational influences, it does so in order to help individuals consider what’s best."
essay99,"Such a principal can be seen by researchers Bocoum et al., who studied the effects of nudging households to take up health insurance in countries where life insurance uptake was very low."
essay99,"The concern that arises, however, is the idea on whether such an action is truly the right way for the individual to make these rational choices."
essay99,"Such a question brings about the conversation about what would occur if no nudges were present.Although critics of the theory argue for such a scenario, many do not take into   consideration how biased humans truly are."
essay99,Consider Nys and Engelen’s example of the apples and Twinkies in the cafeteria once more.
essay99,"For instance, upon labeling calorie information on menu boards in fast-food restaurants within New York City,   researchers found that, after a period of five years, there was no significant change in the frequency of visits to fast food restaurants nor was there much of a change in the nutrients or number of calories purchased (Cantor et al."
essay99,"As such, the nudge is not influencing their decisions and thus is not taking away their autonomy.Because of this, there’s no way in which such a nudge could be labeled as manipulation."
essay99,"Could the nudge towards the apples be considered manipulation simply because it worked in its goal, while the one in New York City could not be considered such since it did not work?"
essay99,"This is not the only case of such a nudge failing, as nudging interventions have also been utilized in order to help improve college achievements within undergraduate students."

essay51,"Currently, nudges are very frequent in our society.For instance, one of the typical examples of social norm, herding, plays an important role influencing the market."
essay51,The herd effect involves an individual ignoring his private decision and follow the herd (follow majorities’ decision).Such action is rational.Presentation of information is another typical example of nudge.
essay51,"This concept involves different framings of information shaping different individual behaviors.Overall, the two examples of nudges mentioned could be beneficial to the society boosting the market to operate, favoring people to make their choices fast."
essay51,"For example, to prevent inflation, the government raised the interest rate.The demand of stock reduces, and consumption would decrease lowering the price level, as more people followed the others who stopped investment and saved more in banks."
essay51,A typical example of nudges affecting autonomy is the default settings.Default settings often occurs when many users in the social media platform forgot to adjust their privacy settings.This ended up with their private information being shared to public which violated their autonomy.
essay51,Such issue could be serious in a society tied up to the nudges.A field experiment described in the article “When the message hurts” was conducted in Romania.
essay51,"A typical example is provided by the journal “Transparency versus informed consent”; when an individual is choosing a doctor for checkup in the hospital, the existence of informed consent and transparency would urge the patient to struggle choosing the appropriate paradigm and the boundary for medicine."
essay6,"For example, a nudge might be placing healthier food options at eye level in a cafeteria to promote healthier eating choices."
essay6,"A prime example of manipulation through nudging can be found in the privacy options on social media platforms.Frequently, the default settings are configured to permit the maximum amount of data sharing."
essay6,"For example, clear nutritional labels on food products and the placement of tobacco products behind the counter can help individuals make healthier choices without restricting their freedom to choose.Excessive or manipulative nudges can undermine an individual’s autonomy."
essay6,The risk for manipulation could be mitigated by ensuring that nudges are designed to be as transparent as possible and that they leave ample room for individuals to make an informed choice.
essay6,"Whatever you believe, nudges should, as much as possible, strive to maintain individual autonomy and promote rational decision-making.Nudges may not always lead to the intended behavior, a phenomenon known as backfiring."

ends up with an objectively worse outcome in life (e.g., being physically unhealthy because of

essay30,"A prime example of this is choosing between eating pizza for 
lunch or having a salad."
essay30,"Why is it important to discuss these ethical implications
 and what are the four biggest ethical issues that currently exist concerning nudge behavior?In 
this paper, these questions will be  explored with concrete examples used to describe each."
essay30,"Going 
back to the previous example, an individual who is deciding what to eat for lunch will always 
have two or more options in this context."
essay30,"An example of this can be found in text written by Richard Thale r and Cass Sunstein: 
Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness  in which various foods were 
placed behind, above, or at eye level of an individual."
essay30,"An example of a 
change in default nudge is automatically renewed payment plans or subscriptio ns."
essay30,"This example of nudging, however, may disadvantage the 
user especially if they were planning on canceling the ir plan but just forgot to."
essay30,"One example of a social norm and 
herding nudge is if the individuals are informed about what others are doing which then thereby 
induces an altered behavior."
essay30,"For example, if a w hole line of students were to say they think that 
the sky was red, the next individual would be more inclined to say the sky was red."
essay30,"An example of this 
nudge is when news anchors purposefully use statistics that sound more impactful to influence 
populations."
essay30,"The previous examples are critical to understanding how these five types of nudges work 
in the real world, though, it is still important to delve into and understand the theory behind the 
concept of nudging."
essay30,"The inventors of the nudging concept, Thaler an d Sunstein, believe nudging 
to be an example of Libertarian Paternalism."
essay30,"Next, nudges unconsciously facilita te access to an individual desired 
choice.Going back to the lunch example, individuals are pushed to make healthier lifestyle 
choices due to the existence of nudges."
essay30,"F or example, if 
you put a marshmallow in front of an individual and place a vegetable further away, the 
individual may reach for the vegetable for some unknown reason that nudge does not account 
for."
essay30,"Ideally, it is 
used to help people make wiser and healthier choices to improve their outcomes, though it can be 
abused and actually harm consumers.An example of inappropriate use is Black Friday   marketing."
essay30,"This marketing is extremely misleading, in the weeks prior to Black Friday, 
companies increase the base price of their goods and then offer discounts such as “50% off the 
whole store”."
essay30,"The welfare of individuals can be 
negatively impacted due to nudging.For example, people are typically positively affected by 
calorie labels on menus making the nudge a good thing."
essay30,"An example of this are 
the various fad diets that are targeted at teenagers who want to lose weight.After  a certain 
amount of time, they default to these diets which deteriorates their health in the long term[ 9]."
essay30,"For 
example, if you offered your friend a burger while they are on a diet, it is up to them to make the 
final decision."
