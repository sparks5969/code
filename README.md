### This project will use a pre-trained transformer (developed by OpenAI) to embed student essays for analysis.

The goal of the project is to evaluate if the use of generative AI tool can improve students' performance in an assigned essay task

By embedding the essays, we can capture the semantic and contextual information of the text, allowing us to perform various analysis tasks such as similarity comparison, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. This will enable us to gain deeper insights into the students' writing skills.

The project will involve the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Spring 2023 as control group, Fall 2023 as treatment group.

2. Preprocessing: The essays will undergo preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to prepare them for embedding.

3. LLM Embedding: The LLM model will be trained on a large corpus of text data to learn the underlying patterns and structures of the language. Each essay will then be transformed into a dense vector representation using the trained LLM model.

4. Analysis and Evaluation: Once the essays are embedded, we can perform a wide range of analysis and evaluation tasks. This may include measuring essay similarity, identifying key topics, detecting sentiment, and evaluating the overall quality of the writing.

5. Reporting: The results of the analysis will be visualized and reported, allowing researchers to easily interpret and understand the findings.
